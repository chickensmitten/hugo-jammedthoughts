# I love to learn.

One of my favorite past time is challenging my preconceived notions. Being wrong for the right reasons puts me out of my comfort zone. Through it, I feel I am improving my life.

**Yet, learning seems to be a frustrating and futile experience.** Why frustrating and futile you ask? Because I tend to forget most of what I learned. After many rounds of this forgetting cycle, I have a sense that it is all for naught. 

I think my issue is that some of the interesting things that I learn tend not to be needed frequently or immediately. With the lack of active recall, I tend to forget. 


## An Example

What do I mean by this? Let me give you an example.

When you buy groceries, because you do this frequently enough on a daily or weekly basis, you tend to know what to purchase and what to avoid. What are the pros and cons of each of your purchasing decisions. 

Say suddenly, there is [pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen), and your government announces a [lockdown](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-modelling-uk-lockdown) without telling when it will end. Your grocery checklist will be very different than the usual one. Should you buy perishable goods or should you overstock on toilet rolls? 

Now imagine, a year earlier, you went for a crash course on how to survive a virus outbreak. Chances are, you will have a hard time remembering everything you learned. Possibly, you might need to refer back to your notes from the crash course. To add on the difficulty, what if the government only gave you [4 hours' notice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html) before the lockdown? Will you have enough time to make the right decisions?

This is the problem I have. This is the problem I am trying to solve. 


## My Problem

No, donâ€™t get me wrong, I am not a victim of a short lockdown notice. What I mean is that with our exposure to so much information every day, there could be useful pieces of unique information or rare knowledge that might come in handy in the future. If only there is a way for me to collect and revise.

So, to scratched my own itch, I created [ThoughtBento](http://thoughtbento.com/)

## ThoughtBento

ThoughtBento is a web application where you can create decks of cards on the topics that you would like to remember. Every day, an email will be sent to you to revise your cards. The revision method will be very similar to [flashcards](https://collegeinfogeek.com/flash-card-study-tips/). You can either create your own cards or subscribe to decks created by other people.

In addition to that, if you think your deck is valuable, you can sell it too. People who purchase your deck will get to subscribe to it to practice daily.


## My Hope

My hope is that one day, with enough daily active recall on fascinating knowledge, I will be able to mix some of the concepts, ideas, and thoughts together, to form new concepts, new ideas and new thoughts that are uniquely useful to me. All because I remember when a serendipitous moment presents itself.

I hope you will find it useful too.
