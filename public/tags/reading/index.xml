      <description>Reading is one of my favorite past times.
There was a point in time where I took the one book a week challenge where I tried to finish a non-fiction book every week. The idea that successful people read a lot was something I wanted to emulate. However, a few months in, I gave up.
I lost motivation, not because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish a book once a week. It&amp;rsquo;s because I forget most of what I read very quickly.</description>
